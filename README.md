# Cognifyz_Internship_ML
The project, provided by Cognifyz Technologies, consists of four tasks aimed at analyzing and modeling restaurant data. Here's a concise description of each task:

Task 1: Predict Restaurant Ratings
Build a machine learning model to predict a restaurant's aggregate rating using features like cuisine, location, and price range. Preprocess the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. Train a regression model (e.g., linear regression, decision tree regression) and evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared. Analyze the model to identify the most influential features affecting ratings.

Task 2: Restaurant Recommendation System
Create a recommendation system based on user preferences such as cuisine type or price range. Preprocess the data and implement a content-based filtering approach to recommend restaurants similar to user preferences. Test the system by providing sample preferences and evaluating the quality of recommendations.

Task 3: Classify Restaurants by Cuisine
Develop a machine learning model to classify restaurants based on their cuisine type. Preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, and train a classification model (e.g., logistic regression, random forest). Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Analyze performance across cuisines and identify potential biases or challenges.

Task 4: Geographical Analysis of Restaurants
Perform a geographical analysis using latitude and longitude data to visualize restaurant distribution on a map. Group restaurants by city or locality and analyze their concentration. Calculate statistics like average ratings, cuisines, or price ranges by area. Identify patterns or insights related to restaurant locations.

These tasks involve data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and analysis to derive actionable insights and predictions from restaurant data.
